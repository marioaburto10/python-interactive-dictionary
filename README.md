# Interactive Python Dictionary

### The purpose of this app is to be an interactive dictionary where a user will input a word and the app will find any definitions pertaining to that word. 

I am loading a `JSON ` file of words and their definitions as key/value pairs, this is the dictionary that I will be using as a reference in my app and can be found in the `Resources` folder. It uses python's `input()` function to ask the user to input a word that they want to know the definition for.

** Upon running `app.py`, the user is asked to input a word that they would like a definition for. If the word is spelled correctly and is found in our `JSON` word dictionary, then it will return that word's definition. If the word has more than one definition it will show the the definitions as a list. **
